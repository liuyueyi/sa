# source code file description
--config.c config.h    
    include the functions to response the request to the volume key file
  function:
   	do_list_xxx() : list the information(such as volume key's id, plain key, volume UUID) of the volume key
   	do_remove_xx(): delete the volume key or the map of volume key and volume
   	do_update_xx(): update the map of volume key and volume
   	do_getline()  : read one line from the volume key file
   	do_putline()  : write one line to the volume key file
   	print_xxxx()  : print the related information(such as volume key's id, plain key and volume UUID)
   
--rsa.c rsa.h
	include RSA encrypt/decrypt algorithm. This is implemented by openssl
  function:
	base64()      : base the unsigned char* to string
	debase64()    : debase the string to original unsigned char*
	rsa_encrypt() : encrypt xxx by public key  
	rsa_decrypt() : decrypt xxx by private key
	rsa_sha1()    : calculate the sha1 digest of the file

--sm2.c sm2.h
	include sm2 encrypt/decrypt algorithm. This is implemented by call encryption card
  function:	
	read_pk()     : read public key from public key file
	read_sk()     : read private key from private key file
	sm2_encrypt() : encrypt xxx by public key
	sm2_decrypt() : decrypt xxx by private key
	sm2_sha1()    : calculate the sha1 digest of the file
	
--encrypt.c encrypt.h
	the uniform encrypt/decrypt interface for the system
  function:
    set_encryption_method() : set the specific encrypt algorithm, and return the encryption struct which contains the encrypt, decrypt and sha1 function

--main.c
	the main function of the sa client for user
	

--server.c server.h
    the sa server, include send volume key file to kmc and receive the volume key from the kmc
  function:
    init_server()        : init the server socket
    server_work()        : loop to accept kmc's request
    verify_client()      : verify client the kmc's identity
    server_process()     : judge the kmc's request(A: receive new volume key; R: recover the volume key; T: back up the volume key)
    receive_volume_key() : receive data from the kmc(should calculate the sha1 digest to ensure receive the correct data)
    send_volume_key()    : send volume key to kmc

--kmd.c 
	the server main function
